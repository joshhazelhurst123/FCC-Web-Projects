API Project: File Metadata Microservice for freeCodeCamp
User stories:
I can submit a form that includes a file upload.
The form file input field has the "name" attribute set to "upfile". We rely on this in testing.
When I submit something, I will receive the file name and size in bytes within the JSON response
Usage :
Go to the main page, and upload a file using the provided form.
Hint:
To handle the file uploading you should use the multer npm package.
